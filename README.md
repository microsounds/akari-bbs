# akari-bbs â€” lightweight messageboard system
akari-bbs is a _**work-in-progress**_ lightweight messageboard system written in C!

### Implemented Features
* Anonymous posting
* Blockquotes and post quoting
* [code] blocks for preserving whitespace in code snippets
* Cooldown timer
* UTF-8 aware input sanitation
* Usernames
* Tripcodes (DES crypt-based a.k.a Futaba-style)
  * Enter your password in the form "name#password" to generate a tripcode.
  * Tripcodes are a simple way to provide persistent identity without registration.

Server-side page response time currently clocks in at 0.8ms. (1/1250th of a second!)

### Warning
This project is in alpha state and is not feature complete. Functionality may change at any time.

Backwards-compatibility for databases created by older versions of this software are not guaranteed.

## Required
* lighttpd
* sqlite3

## Dependencies
* libcrypt (POSIX)
* libsqlite3

## Deployment
1. Install `lighttpd`, `sqlite3`, and `libsqlite3-dev`.
2. In `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`, add the following lines:

   ```ini
   server.modules += "mod_cgi"
   cgi.assign = ( ".cgi"  => "" )
   ```
3. Copy repo to your selected `server.document-root` location.
4. Build project with `make release`.
5. Initialize database and give `www-data` write permission by running `./init.sh` as root.
6. Enable and start Lighttpd using `service` or `systemctl`, depending on your distro.
7. Confirm that everything is working by visiting `localhost/akari-bbs/board.cgi` in your browser.
  * If posting doesn't work, it means `www-data` is not the owner of the database file.
